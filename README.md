## Hello there! 👋
You can find me only on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/matteogabriele.bsky.social), where I mainly discuss open-source and developer-related topics, and maybe other things.

I primarily enjoy creating Vue.js and Nuxt plugins, websites and developing various CLI tools.

I've also built:
- A silly game for developers called [GifRequest](https://gifrequest.com) where you need to match a GIF to a random repository name.
- An app called [AgentScan](https://agentscan.netlify.app/) that tries to understand if a Github account is run by an AI agent or not.
