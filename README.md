## Hello there! 👋
You can find me only on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/matteogabriele.bsky.social), where I mainly discuss open-source and other developer-related topics.

I primarily enjoy creating Vue.js and Nuxt plugins and developing various CLI tools.

I've also built a silly game for developers called [GifRequest](https://gifrequest.com)
